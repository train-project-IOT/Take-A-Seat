# The parameters are at the top of the ESP32 code :

- NUM_OF_SEATS: It is set to be 4, the number of seats that we physically implemented and for which hardware exists.

- is_sitting[NUM_OF_SEATS]: An array describing the four physically available seats, 
			the array reflects in a boolean manner (0 or 1) whether the seat is free (0) or occupied (1).
			At the beginning all are set to be 0 , as free seats.

- force_sensor_pins[NUM_OF_SEATS]: Is set to be {32, 34, 33, 36}.
			An array that defines the ID of the pins through which the output from the sensors will be read, 
			each ID corresponds to the measurement of one of the sensors,
			we will sample the output from the corresponding pin in the ESP32 and receive information as to whether the corresponding seat is free or occupied.

- analogReadings[NUM_OF_SEATS]: An array that stores the value read from each of the pins for each of the seats from the car, 
			if less than the threshold value the seat is free, if greater than the threshold value the seat is occupied.

- READING_FREQUENCY: set to 3 seconds, the frequency with which the sensors are called,
			every three seconds the program rechecks for each of the chairs if it is free or occupied.

- THRESHOLD_VALUE: Set to be 500, the threshold value was chosen after optimal adaptation tests to the weight of a person on a seat.
			The value measured from each pin will be checked against the threshold value and thus it will be decided whether the seat is free or occupied.
