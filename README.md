# Take-A-Seat

## Take-A-Seat Project by: Shoham Dahan, Tamar Gozlan, Noa Admoni

## Details about the project:
A Project in Internet of Things (IoT) - "Take A Seat".

The goal of our project is to reduce the situations that cause train delays.
With the help of force sensors installed on the seats in the train, we can know how many free seats and how many occupied seats there are in each car.
Train platforms will be divided into zones so that in each zone there are several cars and in each zone a screen will be installed that will show how many free seats there are in the cars in that zone and how many.
This will cause the people waiting at the platform to stand in a manner that corresponds to the actual available seats and be distributed to all areas and thus cause a faster boarding and the train doors to close faster and a faster departure of the train from the platform and thus prevent delays.
